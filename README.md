[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

## **Project Overview**

Deepfakes, created using advanced deep learning techniques, pose significant challenges by generating highly convincing yet fake visual content. This project tackles the challenge of detecting such manipulated images using a Dense Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture. Our model leverages EfficientNet, combined with a custom Depthwise Separable Convolution Block (DSCB), to enhance feature extraction while maintaining computational efficiency. The model has been evaluated on diverse datasets, achieving high accuracy in differentiating real from fake images.

### **Key Features**
- **Dense CNN with EfficientNet**: Uses a pre-trained EfficientNet model for efficient and accurate feature extraction.
- **Custom DSCB**: Introduces a Depthwise Separable Convolution Block for enhanced detection of deepfake artifacts.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieves 97% accuracy in detecting manipulated content.
- **Real-world Application**: Designed to combat misinformation, enhance media verification, and safeguard digital content integrity.

## **Model Architecture**

### **Core Architecture**

The model combines the power of EfficientNet for general image classification with a custom Depthwise Separable Convolution Block (DSCB) designed to enhance the detection of deepfake artifacts. This allows the model to focus on both spatial details and inter-channel relationships in images, making it highly effective for deepfake detection.
